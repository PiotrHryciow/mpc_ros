# **MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL FOR REFERENCE PATH TRACKING IN ROS**

### 1. Objective
This project uses MPC (model predictive control), to calculate steering values (acceleration and steering angles) for car like robots. The main point of this package is position reference tracking. It uses kinematic bicycle model as system model.
